<p>Hello, welcome to my personal page. What kind of a coincidence that destiny has steered you here! My name is WHY, a mathematics student at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/">Imperial College London</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a glimpse of me is in a self-indentified portrait, crafted by some anonymous soul painter :</p>

<h2 id="academic-interests">Academic Interests</h2>

<p>My academic interest lies at the crossroads of theoretical physics and geometry, particularly in areas like differential geometry and geometrical analysis. (A little tidbit: during my first year at Imperial, I worked on an <a href="/study/Imperial_mathematics/year_1/Individual_Research_Project/Individual_Research_Project_main">individual project program</a> and took part in a <a href="/study/Imperial_mathematics/year_1/UROP/UROP_main">UROP</a>, both connected to these subjects.)</p>

<p>Besides, I am also intrigued by mathematical logic and formalizing mathematics. During that same first year at Imperial, I worked on the other <a href="/study/Imperial_mathematics/year_1/UROP/UROP_main">UROP</a> that involved building a group theory game on a website, aiming to teach people to prove mathematical propositions in Lean (a kind of functional programming language) and the basic concepts and theorems in group theory. My friends and I are still working on it. When it was polished, I will put a link here.</p>

<p>I’m also drawn to applied mathematics, which nudges me towards the realms of optimization, data science, and machine learning.</p>

<h2 id="career-and-entrepreneurship">Career and Entrepreneurship</h2>

<p>When mathematics gets a bit overwhelming, I ponder a path that involves being a quantitative analyst in a buyer sider finance company or a data scientist in a tech outfit. I’m well aware that these paths are no easy journey, yet I’m striving to strike a balance between my studies and hands-on skills.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I’m not very certain about finding a long-term spot in the academic world. It’s a realm of fierce competition, even more challenging than landing a position in a top hedge fund with handsome rewards. This uncertainty has led me to consider other avenues. In fact, I’m currently on the lookout for internships in quantitative analysis and data science, particularly for my second-year summer break.</p>

<p>In addition, I’m also a founder and co-founder of <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/q-YlYrhkzNo1mfha0E4QKw">DAA</a> a Study Abroad Service Company. Our focus is on helping students explore opportunities for studying abroad, especially in Commonwealth countries. This involves providing guidance for international courses like A-level, AP, IB, as well as preparing for Oxbridge admission exams and advice on writing a personal statement to apply university，etc. The name of our company is inspired by the famous British comedy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister"><em>Yes, Minister</em></a> , specifically the Department of Administrative Affairs. A friend of mine suggested the name. I initiated this effort with the intention of supporting students from regular high schools in China who aspire to pursue education abroad.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>In my free time, music is my constant companion. From Classical to Jazz, Rock-n-Roll, and Pop, I enjoy them all. I’m a true fan of “good” music, swaying to its rhythm like no one’s watching. For more about this musical side, check out my music page.</p>

<p>Literature also has its hold on me, especially Russian literature (from 1924). A writer I admire is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a>(1860-1904). His plays are a favorite. If you share this fondness, feel free to connect.</p>

<p>By the way, the name of this site  is inspired by Kafka’s well-known story <em>A Hunger artist</em>. If you’re curious, you can read it in <a href="/literature/stories/Franz_Kafka/A_Hunger_Artist">English</a>, <a href="/literature/stories/Franz_Kafka/饥饿艺术家">Chinese</a> or <a href="/literature/stories/Franz_Kafka/Ein_Hungerkuenstler">Original German</a>.</p>

<p>The phrase “<em>Muss es sein? Es muss sein!</em>” that you see beneath my name comes from a piece of music composed by Beethoven. It is quoted from the fourth movement of Beethoven: String Quartet No. 16 in F major, Op. 135. This particular phrase means “<em>Must it be? It must be!</em>”. If you are intereted, you can listen to it <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zx411Z7t6/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.-1&amp;vd_source=fe2d68b49d744ceffb09c45be39b9f4a">here</a>.</p>
